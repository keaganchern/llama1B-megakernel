# NKI Common Pitfalls & Fixes

## Compiler Errors

### NCC_IBIR158 — illegal SBUF/PSUM access pattern
**Error**: `NCC_IBIR158: ...`
**Cause**: SBUF/PSUM `.ap()` call violates the contiguous-partition constraint: the first tuple's step must equal the total free-dimension element count. Reading every-other partition or any non-contiguous partition stride triggers this error.
**Fix**: Ensure the first tuple step matches the free-dim size, or use direct slice indexing instead:
```python
# ILLEGAL — step=64 skips partitions on a (128, 32) tensor (free_dim=32, step must be 32)
t.ap(pattern=[[64, 64], [1, 32]], offset=0)

# LEGAL — step=32 matches free_dim
t.ap(pattern=[[32, 128], [1, 32]], offset=0)

# ALTERNATIVE — for simple column access, direct slice avoids .ap() entirely
col = sbuf_tensor[0:T, expert_id:expert_id+1]
```

### NCC_IXCG864 — ISA check failed on `activation_reduce`
**Error**: `[NCC_IXCG864] ISA check failed`
**Cause**: Using `nisa.activation_reduce(op=nl.square, reduce_op=nl.add)` — the compiler does not support this op/reduce combination even though the API exists.
**Fix**: Replace with separate `nisa.activation(op=nl.square)` followed by `nisa.tensor_reduce(reduce_op=nl.add)`.

### NCC_INLA001 — Dynamic SBUF access not allowed
**Error**: `[NCC_INLA001] Dynamic Access is not allowed in the instruction`
**Cause**: Attempting SBUF-to-SBUF `tensor_copy` with a runtime `scalar_offset` (e.g., indexing into a preloaded buffer by a runtime index). The compiler requires all SBUF access patterns to be statically known.
**Fix**: Accept the HBM traffic cost — load the needed slice from HBM each time rather than preloading into SBUF and indexing dynamically.

### NCC_IBIR030 — `scalar_offset` without `.ap()` descriptor
**Error**: `NCC_IBIR030: ...`
**Cause**: Passing an SBUF tensor directly (or a 1×1 slice) as `scalar_offset` to a DGE instruction without an `.ap()` descriptor. The compiler requires `.ap()` to derive `IndirectDimMaxIndex`.
**Fix**: Wrap the SBUF tensor in `.ap()` with a shape that encodes the max index. See `nki-syntax-quickref.md` for the `(128,1)` access pattern.

### DGE `scalar_offset` absolute SBUF address bug (silent wrong results in E2E)
**Symptom**: Kernel passes standalone correctness tests but produces wrong outputs (garbage scatter/gather) when run inside a full model.
**Cause**: Using a computed `offset` (e.g., `offset=t*K+k`) in `.ap()` on an SBUF tensor bakes in an *absolute* SBUF address at compile time. In standalone tests the tensor is at a predictable SBUF location, so it resolves correctly. In E2E model compilation, earlier model tensors shift the allocation, so the baked address points to residual activations instead of the intended data.
**Fix**: Copy the single element of interest into a dedicated scratch tensor at its base (partition 0, element 0), then reference with `offset=0`. The `(128,1)` shape preserves `IndirectDimMaxIndex=127` for the compiler.

### Compiler error after adding `affine_range`
**Cause**: `affine_range` used on a loop that carries a data dependency (accumulation into PSUM, sequential accumulation loops, etc.).
**Fix**: Revert to `sequential_range` for that loop. Only use `affine_range` when you are certain iterations are independent.

> **[TRN3-ONLY pitfalls omitted]**: NCC_IBIR530 (`nc_matmul_mx` Trn3-only), `float8_e4m3fn` BIR verification, "TensorScalarPtr arith immediate dtype must be fp32" (POST_SCALE float32 requirement) — these only apply when using FP8/MXFP, which trn1 (NCv2) does not support.

### Shape mismatch in `nc_matmul`
**Cause**: Wrong tensor layout — `stationary` must be `[par_dim, K]`, `moving` must be `[K, free_dim]`.
**Fix**: Verify layouts and add `nisa.nc_transpose` if needed before calling `nc_matmul`.

## Incorrect Results

### Output tensor stays zero / all zeros
**Causes** (in order of likelihood):
1. Forgot to call `nl.store(output_hbm, result_sbuf)`.
2. Stored to an SBUF tensor instead of the HBM output argument.
3. PSUM buffer not copied to SBUF before storing (PSUM→HBM direct store is not valid).

**Fix**:
```python
# Always: PSUM → SBUF → HBM
nl.copy(sbuf_tmp, psum_result)     # PSUM → SBUF
nl.store(output_hbm[...], sbuf_tmp) # SBUF → HBM
```

### NaN / Inf outputs
**Causes**:
- Float overflow: bf16 range is ~65504 max. Add scaling before accumulation.
- Division by zero in softmax denominator — add epsilon: `nl.maximum(denom, 1e-9)`.
- Uninitialized PSUM — always memset before use: `nl.zeros(...)` or explicit init.

### Wrong numerics (large max_diff)
**Causes**:
- Mixed precision accumulation: intermediate in bf16 when fp32 is needed.
- Incorrect reduction axis.
- Missing scale factor (e.g., `1/sqrt(d_k)` in attention).

> **[TRN3-ONLY]**: Per-partition FP8 scale correctness, FP8 NaN bit-pattern in tests — these only matter for FP8 work on trn2/trn3; trn1 doesn't use FP8.

## Performance Issues

### Kernel compiles but is slow
**Checklist**:
1. Are all independent DMA loads inside `affine_range` loops? (Enables prefetching)
2. Are there repeated `nl.load` calls for the same HBM tensor? (Use hoisting or caching)
3. Is SBUF overflowing? (Check `spill_save_bytes` in neuron-profile)
4. Are intermediate buffers declared outside inner loops? (Declare inside to avoid spilling — see performance-guide.md Opt #2 gotcha)

### DMA not overlapping with compute
**Cause**: Using `sequential_range` on loops with independent DMA loads.
**Fix**: Switch to `affine_range` on the outer tile loop.

### Poor MFU on matmul
**Causes**:
- Tile size too small — increase free-dimension tile size.
- Stationary matrix not held in SBUF across multiple moving tiles (missing loop reordering).

### Instruction scheduler is extremely sensitive to code order
**Symptom**: A semantically-equivalent reordering (moving a memset, reordering loop bodies, changing instruction type) causes 3–13% latency regression with no logical change.
**Cause**: NKI's compiler scheduling is fragile — any reordering changes internal optimization passes. Examples observed:
- Prefetching Wave-1 DMAs inside Wave-0 loop: +5.5% regression
- Moving PSUM memsets by a few lines: +6.5% regression
- Replacing two `ScalarE` calls with one fused instruction of a different engine type: +4.2% regression
- Replacing 6 `nc_transpose` calls with 2 `dma_transpose` calls on an already DMA-bottlenecked kernel: +3.8% regression
**Rule**: Change exactly one thing per round. Revert immediately if latency worsens by >2%. Do not "clean up" or reorder working code.

### Merging loops does not improve DMA/compute overlap
**Symptom**: Combining two sequential `static_range` loops into one expecting overlap — latency increases instead.
**Cause**: Merged loop bodies create longer dependency chains, reducing the compiler's freedom to parallelize. The compiler already handles inter-loop scheduling adequately.
**Fix**: Keep loops separate. Do not merge hoping for overlap improvements.

### 3D indirect DMA generates more packets than two 2D DMAs
**Symptom**: Combining two 2D indirect DMA patterns into one 3D pattern increases `sw_dma_packet_count` and latency.
**Cause**: The compiler splits 3D indirect DMAs into multiple descriptor chains. Observed: 3D pattern generated 8192 packets vs 7936 for equivalent 2D patterns.
**Fix**: Use simple 2D DMA patterns for indirect (software DGE) addressing. Multi-dimensional indirect patterns do not offer compiler optimization.

### Removing a "redundant" memset causes regression
**Symptom**: A memset whose destination is immediately overwritten by subsequent DMAs appears safe to remove — but removing it increases latency.
**Cause**: The instruction creates a scheduling dependency the compiler relies on, even though the written data is overwritten. Do not remove memsets without profiling before and after.

### [TRN2/TRN3-ONLY] `double_row` perf mode does not work at T=1
**Cause**: `double_row` (the FP8 2× throughput mode on NCv3) requires the moving tensor's access pattern to have `Num=2`. At T=1 the moving tensor is `[128, 1]` with `Num=1` — the constraint is not satisfied.
**Impact**: The 2× FP8 matmul throughput from `double_row` is only available for batch (CTE) workloads, not single-token decode (TKG). Not relevant on trn1, which has no `double_row` mode in the first place.

### SBUF pressure directly degrades scheduling quality
**Finding**: Reducing from 8 buffer sets to 4 freed ~96 KiB of SBUF and improved latency by 12%. Increasing PSUM columns from 48 to 96 caused regression. The 48-column configuration beat both 96 and 12.
**Why**: SBUF pressure constrains the compiler's ability to assign non-overlapping live ranges, reducing instruction-level parallelism.
**Rule**: Treat SBUF allocation minimization as a first-order performance lever, not just a correctness concern.

## Environment & Runtime

### "NeuronCore busy" / process conflicts
**Cause**: Another Python process is holding the NeuronCores.
**Fix**: Kill all other Python processes using Neuron devices, then re-run. NeuronCores are exclusive — only one process at a time.

### `nki.benchmark` not working
**Cause**: `nki.benchmark` does not work in the `pytorch_2_9_nxd_inference` environment.
**Fix**: Use wall-clock timing instead:
```python
import time, torch
def bench(fn, *args, warmup=5, iters=20):
    for _ in range(warmup): fn(*args)
    torch.xla.sync()
    t0 = time.perf_counter()
    for _ in range(iters): fn(*args)
    torch.xla.sync()
    print(f"{(time.perf_counter()-t0)/iters*1e3:.3f} ms/iter")
```

### nkilib kernel JIT invocation: standard vs trace-style
**Two distinct calling conventions exist — mixing them causes silent failure:**
- **Standard JIT** (returns output tensor): `out = attention_cte(q, k, v, ...)`
- **Trace-style JIT** (writes in-place, returns status): `status = attention_tkg_jit(..., out=out_tensor)`

Check the kernel signature before calling. Trace-style kernels require `nki.jit(kernel, mode="trace")` and an explicit `out=` argument.

### "Entry function not found" when wrapping a jitted library kernel
**Cause**: Calling `nki.jit()` on a function that itself calls an already-jitted nkilib kernel — nested JIT is not supported.
**Fix**: Apply `nki.jit` only to leaf kernels: `nki.jit(attention_tkg, mode="trace")` directly.

### `neuron-profile` `*_percent` fields are fractions, not percentages
**Cause**: `neuron-profile summary-json` returns `tensor_engine_percent`, `dma_active_percent`, etc. as values in `[0.0, 1.0]`.
**Fix**: Multiply by 100 before displaying or comparing against thresholds. A value of `0.85` means 85%, not 0.85%.

### `NEURON_PLATFORM_TARGET_OVERRIDE` not set
**Symptom**: Kernel compiles for wrong device or fails with architecture mismatch.
**Fix**: Always export before running:
```bash
export NEURON_PLATFORM_TARGET_OVERRIDE=trn1
```

## Debugging Protocol

When a kernel fails to compile:
1. Strip back to bare minimum (no fusion, no `affine_range`, no advanced tiling).
2. Add one optimization at a time, compiling after each addition.
3. Check shapes/dtypes at every intermediate step.
4. Use `print()` liberally — remember prints execute at compile time, so they're free for debugging shape issues.
5. For `nki.isa` failures: check tile/layout constraints in the architecture guide.

When a kernel gives wrong results:
1. Run on tiny shapes (e.g., T=2, H=64) to make inspection easier.
2. Print intermediate SBUF tensor values at compile time to verify shapes are correct.
3. Add `nl.device_print` for runtime values (expensive, debug-only).
4. Compare step-by-step against a NumPy reference.
